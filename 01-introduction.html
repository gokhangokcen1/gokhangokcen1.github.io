            <b>Short answer:</b> Feynman method, teach to learn, and writing helps me to focus something.

        <p> <b>Long answer:</b> I read a book about Leonardo da Vinci (by Walter Isaacson), and it mentioned that he
            kept
            notebooks called
            codices. He wrote down his knowledge and ideas on various subjects in these codices, including how birds
            fly, architectural design, weapons, and hydraulic engineering. I was surprised and admired how he could work
            (and think) about so many things at once. It made me wonder what subjects were running through my own head.
            There's just too much "mental clutter" these days, like social media distractions and wasteful thoughts.
            Inspired by Leonardo, I decided to focus my mind on understanding how things work – engineering, biology,
            physics, human science, the arts, and even the universe itself. This is the beginning of my journey. I'll be
            talking about what I learn and the thoughts that come to mind along the way.</p>
